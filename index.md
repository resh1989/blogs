## Code that matters – Importance of coding standards in software engineering

### The problem
As a start-up, the product built to address the customer pain-areas considers the time-to-market losing focus on the long-term maintainability, consistency, and reusability. As with every other team, the initial focus is to break even and have a good customer base with maximum features out. 
 
The problem: the product being built, though, solves the customer problem was getting hard to maintain and scale for the engineering team. The list of bugs because of code quality or lack of understanding of the code written by other developers was piling up. The phrase that goes “Speed thrills but kills” was starting to get real.

### The reason
Now as a team, understanding the root cause for the piled-up issues was getting more important than having temporary fixes to go sprint by sprint. Adding to that, Agile Development was already having its play to release new features. For us the releases that were planned are important but we also realized the importance of code quality and reusability when time demanded it.

Diving deep into the issues as part of the development and testing activities, the root causes are linked to the following major reasons:
1.	Different style of coding by different developers	
2.	Variable names being not descriptive enough
3.	Functions or handlers not named well to understand their functionality
4.	Nested navigation through code files to understand the code
5.	Conflicts created because of difference in variable names
6.	Redundant code
7.	Too many conditional checks, leading to failure if new values are added or the old values are altered
8.	Too many unused variables and unnecessary commented code leading to confusions
9.	The improper naming convention for components and pages
10.	Lack of documentation for the usage of components

### The outcome
What were these findings leading to? We realized that though we were planning for code reusability and maintainability (at least at a smaller scale) things were not as expected. We realized the need to take a pause and decide on how to improve the situation. We decided to build our coding standards. 

### How did we start?
Ahh here comes the tricky question. We developed, we tested, we failed, we investigated and we found the problem. Now we know a solution to make it better, BUT, how and where to start? The coding standards were something which will help us improve but when we look out for suggestions there are a lot, which differs by technology, the model or development pattern followed by the teams, and some adopted by certain reputed organizations. Where will we start from? Will we adopt one of these? Will we go by one technology standard? How do we derive ours? To answer all these, we decided to MEET with the team. But what we also decided was to ask each member of the team to note down the problems they faced and also suggest a solution on how it can be solved.

The coding standards once derived were to be adopted by the developers and so listening to their problems and suggestions appeared to be important. 

### The plan
As the development has already started and the future releases planned, accommodating code changes for clean-up and quality is under debate. This may affect the momentum until the updates have happened for the existing codebase and that has to be prioritized. 
Agile has given us the flexibility of continuous improvements but as we started to make decisions what we had not planned for is the disagreements or the choices on what is the right approach out of the many possible ways to code, thanks to the plethora of languages and the continuous improvements.

Also, looking at the various tools and ideas available online on how to implement the standards we are considering a few to
1.	Avoid re-work
2.	Automating checks using lint tools
3.	Identifying the cases where one or more ways of writing code are considered
4.	Having the standards documented and available for use, review, and feedback or improvements

We are taking time out to understand and decide the standards based on our journey to build the product so far. We also realize that as we are to develop, we will have more learnings and so will evolve with time. The fact to not go overboard with the enforcement of standards is the key to our decisions.

### Coming up next 
Next would be our experience documenting and implementing the coding standards. The learnings we had and the consequences of implementation. Watch out this space for more information

### What we are looking for
We look forward to suggestions on how your team, small or big, has done things right with the implementation of coding standards. What would be your directions or suggestions to a peer group trying to do things right. Looking out for some great discussions!!
